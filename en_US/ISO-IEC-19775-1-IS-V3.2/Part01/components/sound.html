16.2 Concepts</h1>

<h2><a name="Soundpriority"></a>
16.2.1 Sound priority</h2>

<p>If the browser does not have the resources to play all of the currently active 
  sounds, it is recommended that the browser sort the active sounds into an ordered 
  list using the following sort keys in the order specified:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>decreasing <i>priority;</i></li>
  <li>for sounds with <i>priority</i> &gt; 0.5, increasing (now-<i>startTime</i>);</li>
  <li>decreasing <i>intensity</i> at viewer location (<i>intensity </i>Ã— &quot;intensity 
    attenuation&quot;);</li>
</ol>

<p>where <i>priority </i>is the <i>priority</i> field of the Sound node, now represents 
  the current time, <i>startTime</i> is the <i>startTime</i> field of the audio 
  source node specified in the <i>source</i> field, and &quot;intensity attenuation&quot; 
  refers to the intensity multiplier derived from the linear decibel attenuation 
  ramp between inner and outer ellipsoids.</p>

<p>It is important that sort key 2 be used for the high priority (event and cue) 
  sounds so that new cues will be heard even when the browser is &quot;full&quot; 
  of currently active high priority sounds. Sort key 2 should not be used for 
  normal priority sounds, so selection among them will be based on sort key 3 
  (intensity at the location of the viewer).</p>

<p>The browser shall play as many sounds from the beginning of this sorted list 
  as it can given available resources and allowable latency between rendering. 
  On most systems, the resources available for MIDI streams are different from 
  those for playing sampled sounds, thus it may be beneficial to maintain a separate 
  list to handle MIDI data.</p>

<h2><a name="Soundattenandspatial"></a>
16.2.2 Sound attenuation and spatialization</h2>

<p>In order to create a linear decrease in loudness as the viewer moves from the 
  inner to the outer ellipsoid of the sound, the attenuation must be based on 
  a linear decibel ramp. To make the falloff consistent across browsers, the decibel 
  ramp is to vary from 0 dB at the minimum ellipsoid to -20 dB at the outer ellipsoid. 
  Sound nodes with an outer ellipsoid that is ten times larger than the minimum 
  will display the inverse square intensity drop-off that approximates sound attenuation 
  in an anechoic environment.</p>

<p>Browsers may support spatial localization of sounds whose <i>spatialize</i> 
  field is <code>TRUE</code> as well as their underlying sound 
  libraries will allow. Browsers shall at least support stereo panning of non-MIDI 
  sounds based on the angle between the viewer and the source. This angle is obtained 
  by projecting the <a href="#Sound">Sound</a> <i>location</i> (in global space) onto the XZ plane 
  of the viewer. Determine the angle between the Z-axis and the vector from the 
  viewer to the transformed <i>location</i>, and assign a pan value in the range 
  [0.0, 1.0] as depicted in <a href="#f-Stereopanning">Figure 16.1</a>. Given 
  this pan value, left and right channel levels can be obtained using the following 
  equations:</p>

<p class="Equation">    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leftPanFactor&nbsp; = 1 - pan<sup>2</sup><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rightPanFactor = 1 - (1 - pan)<sup>2</sup><br>
</p>

<p class="FigureCaption">
Figure 16.1 &#8212; Stereo panning</p>

</div>

<p>Using this technique, the loudness of the sound is modified by the <i> intensity</i> 
  field value, then distance attenuation to obtain the unspatialized audio output. 
  The values in the unspatialized audio output are then scaled by leftPanFactor 
  and rightPanFactor to determine the final left and right output signals. The 
  use of more sophisticated localization techniques is encouraged, but not required 
  (see <a href="../bibliography.html#[SNDB]"> 
  [SNDB]</a>).</p>

<p>An AudioClip node specifies audio data that can be referenced 
by <a href="#Sound">Sound</a> nodes.</p>

        <p>The <i>description</i> field specifies a textual description 
          of the audio source. A browser is not required to display the <i>description</i> 
          field but may choose to do so in addition to playing the sound.</p>

        <p>The <i>url</i> field specifies the URL from which the 
          sound is loaded. Browsers shall support at least the <i>wavefile</i> 
          format in uncompressed PCM format (see 
<a href="../bibliography.html#[WAV]">[WAV]</a>). It is recommended that 
          browsers also support the MIDI file type 1 sound format 
(see <a href="../references.html#[MIDI]">2.[MIDI]</a>) and the MP3 compressed 
        format (see <a href="../references.html#[I11172_1]">2.[I11172-1]</a>). MIDI files are 
presumed to use the General 
          MIDI patch set. <a href="networking.html#URLs">9.2.1 URLs</a> contains 
          details on the <i>url</i> field.</p>

        <p>The <i>loop, pauseTime, resumeTime, startTime,</i> and<i> stopTime</i> inputOutput fields 
          and the <i>elapsedTime, isActive, </i>and<i> isPaused</i> outputOnly fields, and their effects on the AudioClip node, 
          are discussed in detail in <a href="time.html">8 Time component</a>. 
          The &quot;<i>cycle&quot;</i> of an AudioClip is the length of time in 
          seconds for one playing of the audio at the specified <i>pitch</i>.</p>

        <p>The <i>pitch</i> field specifies a multiplier for the 
          rate at which sampled sound is played. Values for the <i>pitch</i> field 
          shall be greater than zero<i>.</i> Changing the <i>pitch</i> field affects 
          both the pitch and playback speed of a sound. A <i>set_pitch</i> event 
          to an active AudioClip is ignored and no <i>pitch_changed</i> field 
          is generated. If <i>pitch</i> is set to 2.0, the sound shall be played 
          one octave higher than normal and played twice as fast. For a sampled 
          sound, the <i>pitch</i> field alters the sampling rate at which the 
          sound is played. The proper implementation of pitch control for MIDI 
          (or other note sequence sound clips) is to multiply the tempo of the 
          playback by the <i>pitch</i> value and adjust the MIDI Coarse Tune and 
          Fine Tune controls to achieve the proper pitch change.</p>

        <p>A <i>duration_changed</i> event is sent whenever there 
          is a new value for the &quot;normal&quot; duration of the clip. Typically, 
          this will only occur when the current <i>url</i> in use changes and 
          the sound data has been loaded, indicating that the clip is playing 
          a different sound source. The duration is the length of time in seconds 
          for one cycle of the audio for a <i>pitch</i> set to 1.0. Changing the 
          <i>pitch</i> field will not trigger a <i>duration_changed</i> event. 
          A duration value of &quot;&minus;1&quot; implies that the sound data has not 
          yet loaded or the value is unavailable for some reason. A <i>duration_changed</i> 
          event shall be generated if the AudioClip node is loaded when the X3D 
          file is read or the AudioClip node is added to the scene graph.</p>

        <p>The <i>isActive</i> field may be used by other nodes to 
          determine if the clip is currently active. If an AudioClip is active, 
          it shall be playing the sound corresponding to the sound time (<i>i.e.</i>,&nbsp;in 
          the sound's local time system with sample 0 at time 0):</p>

<p>The Sound node specifies the spatial presentation of a 
    sound in a X3D scene. The sound is located at a point in the local coordinate 
    system and emits sound in an elliptical pattern (defined by two ellipsoids). 
    The ellipsoids are oriented in a direction specified by the <i>direction</i> 
    field. The shape of the ellipsoids may be modified to provide more or 
    less directional focus from the location of the sound.</p>

<p>The <i>source</i> field specifies the sound source for 
   the Sound node. If the <i>source</i> field is not specified, the Sound 
   node will not emit audio. The <i>source</i> field shall specify either 
   an <a href="#AudioClip">AudioClip</a> node or a 
<a href="texturing.html#MovieTexture">MovieTexture</a> node. If a MovieTexture node is 
   specified as the sound source, the MovieTexture shall refer to a movie 
   format that supports sound (<span class="example">EXAMPLE</span> &nbsp;MPEG-1Systems, see
<a href="../references.html#[I11172_1]">ISO/IEC 11172-1</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>intensity </i>field adjusts the loudness (decibels) 
          of the sound emitted by the Sound node.&nbsp; The <i>intensity</i> 
          field has a value that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and specifies a factor 
          which shall be used to scale the normalized sample data of the sound 
          source during playback. A Sound node with an intensity of 1.0 shall 
          emit audio at its maximum loudness (before attenuation), and a Sound 
          node with an intensity of 0.0 shall emit no audio. Between these values, 
          the loudness should increase linearly from a -20 dB change approaching 
          an <i>intensity</i> of 0.0 to a 0 dB change at an <i>intensity</i> of 
          1.0.</p>
<p class="Example">NOTE &nbsp;This is different 
          from the traditional definition of intensity with respect to sound; 
          see <a href="../bibliography.html#[SNDA]">[SNDA]</a>.</p>

        <p>The <i>priority</i> field provides a hint for the browser 
          to choose which sounds to play when there are more active Sound nodes 
          than can be played at once due to either limited system resources or 
          system load. <a href="#Concepts">16.2 Concepts</a> describes a 
          recommended algorithm for determining which sounds to play under such 
          circumstances. The <i>priority</i> field ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 
          1.0 being the highest priority and 0.0 the lowest priority.</p>

        <p>The <i>location</i> field determines the location of the 
          sound emitter in the local coordinate system. A Sound node's output 
          is audible only if it is part of the traversed scene. Sound nodes that 
          are descended from <a href="navigation.html#LOD">LOD</a>, 
		<a href="group.html#Switch">Switch</a>, or any grouping or prototype node that 
          disables traversal (<i>i.e.</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>drawing) of its children are not 
          audible unless they are traversed. If a Sound node is disabled by a 
          Switch or LOD node, and later it becomes part of the traversal again, 
          the sound shall resume where it would have been had it been playing 
          continuously.</p>

        <p>The Sound node has an inner ellipsoid that defines a volume 
          of space in which the maximum level of the sound is audible. Within 
          this ellipsoid, the normalized sample data is scaled by the <i>intensity</i> 
          field and there is no attenuation. The inner ellipsoid is defined by 
          extending the <i>direction</i> vector through the <i>location</i>. The 
          <i>minBack</i> and <i>minFront</i> fields specify distances behind and 
          in front of the <i>location</i> along the <i>direction</i> vector respectively. 
          The inner ellipsoid has one of its foci at <i>location</i> (the second 
          focus is implicit) and intersects the <i>direction</i> vector at <i>minBack</i> 
          and <i>minFront</i>.</p>

        <p>The Sound node has an outer ellipsoid that defines a volume 
          of space that bounds the audibility of the sound. No sound can be heard 
          outside of this outer ellipsoid. The outer ellipsoid is defined by extending 
          the <i>direction</i> vector through the <i>location</i>. The <i>maxBack</i> 
          and <i>maxFront </i>fields specify distances behind and in front of 
          the <i>location</i> along the <i>direction</i> vector respectively. 
          The outer ellipsoid has one of its foci at <i>location</i> (the second 
          focus is implicit) and intersects the <i>direction</i> vector at <i>maxBack</i> 
          and <i>maxFront</i>.</p>

        <p>The <i>minFront</i>, <i>maxFront</i>, <i>minBack</i>, 
          and <i>maxBack</i> fields are defined in local coordinates, and shall 
          be greater than or equal to zero. The <i>minBack</i> field shall be 
          less than or equal to&nbsp;<i>maxBack</i>, and <i>minFront</i> shall 
          be less than or equal to&nbsp;<i>maxFront.</i> The ellipsoid parameters 
          are specified in the local coordinate system but the ellipsoids' geometry 
          is affected by ancestors' transformations.</p>

        <p>Between the two ellipsoids, there shall be a linear attenuation 
          ramp in loudness, from 0 dB at the minimum ellipsoid to -20 dB at the 
          maximum ellipsoid:</p>

<pre class="listing">    attenuation = -20 &times; (d' / d&quot;)
</pre>

<p>where d' is the distance along the location-to-viewer 
   vector, measured from the transformed minimum ellipsoid boundary to 
   the viewer, and d&quot; is the distance along the location-to-viewer 
   vector from the transformed minimum ellipsoid boundary to the transformed 
   maximum ellipsoid boundary (see

<p>The <i>spatialize</i> field specifies if the sound is 
          perceived as being directionally located relative to the viewer. If 
          the <i>spatialize </i>field is <code>TRUE</code> 
          and the viewer is located between the transformed inner and outer ellipsoids,

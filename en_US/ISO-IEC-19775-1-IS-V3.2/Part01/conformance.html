6.1.2 Objectives</H2>

<P>The primary objectives of the specifications in this clause are:</P>

<OL START="1" TYPE="a">
  <LI>to promote interoperability by eliminating arbitrary subsets of, or
  extensions to, ISO/IEC 19775;</li>
  <LI>to promote uniformity in the development of conformance tests;</li>
  <LI>to promote consistent results across X3D browsers;</li>
  <LI>to facilitate automated test generation.</li>
</OL>

<H2><a name="Scope"></a>
6.1.3 Scope</H2>

<P>Conformance is defined for X3D files and for X3D browsers. For X3D
generators, conformance guidelines are presented for enhancing the likelihood
of successful interoperability.</P>

<P>A concept of <I>base profile conformance</I> is defined to ensure interoperability
of X3D generators and X3D browsers. Base profile conformance is based
on a set of limits and minimal requirements. Base profile conformance is
intended to provide a functional level of reasonable utility for X3D generators
while limiting the complexity and resource requirements of X3D browsers.
Base profile conformance may not be adequate for all uses of X3D.</P>

<P>This clause addresses the X3D data stream and implementation requirements.
Implementation requirements include the latitude allowed for X3D generators
and X3D&nbsp;browsers. This clause does not directly address the environmental,
performance, or resource requirements of the generator or browser.</P>

<P>This clause does not define the application requirements or dictate application
functional content within a X3D file.</P>

<P>The scope of this clause is limited to rules for the open interchange
of X3D content.</P>

<OL START="1" TYPE="a">
	<li type="a">The X3D file contains as its first element an X3D header

	specified in this part of ISO/IEC 19775 for the version specified in the

	<li type="a">No nodes appear in the X3D file other than those specified for 
	the applicable profile as specified in this part of ISO/IEC 19775 unless 
	specified in a COMPONENT statement, are required for the encoding technique,

	available in the profile.</li>
	<li type="a">No nodes or fields appear in the X3D file other than those

<H2><a name="ConformanceX3Dgens"></a>
6.2.2 Conformance of X3D generators</H2>

<P>A X3D generator is conforming to ISO/IEC 19775 if all X3D
files that are generated are syntactically correct and meet the requirements 
state in <a href="#ConformanceX3Dfiles">6.2.1 Conformance of X3D files</a>.</P>

6.3.1 Minimum support requirements for generators</H2>

<P>There is no minimum complexity which is required of (or appropriate for) X3D 
generators. Any compliant set of nodes of arbitrary complexity may be generated, 
as appropriate to represent application content, and which produce only the 
nodes allowed by the applicable profile, components, and version.</P>

<H2><a name="Minsupportforbrowser"></a>
6.3.2 Minimum support requirements for browsers</H2>

<P>Each profile defines the minimum complexity which shall be supported
by an X3D browser in support of that profile. Browser implementations may choose to support greater
limits but may not reduce the limits described for the applicable profile. When the 
X3D file contains nodes which exceed the limits implemented
by the browser, the results are undefined. The words &quot;optionally supported&quot; in the minimum 
browser support column refers only to the display of the item; in particular, <i>
set_</i> events to ignored inputOutput fields shall still generate corresponding
<i>_changed</i> events. Where latitude is specified in a table 
of minimum support requirements for a particular node, full support is
required for other aspects of that node.</P>

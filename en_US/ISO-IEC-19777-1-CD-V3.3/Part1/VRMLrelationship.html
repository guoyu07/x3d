<p>Annex C ECMAScript scripting reference of
<a href="references.html#[I14772_1]">Part 1 of ISO/IEC 14772</a> defines an ECMAScript
specification to the script interface. Most of the standard objects added by
this specification are interchangable. However, due to the differing
capabilities of the SAI and VRML services, the Browser object definitions are
not interchangeable between the two environments. This applies to all of the
objects defined in ISO/IEC 14772-1 C ECMAScript scripting reference. This
specification defines the interfaces that user code shall use in order to
interact with an X3D scene graph.</p>
<p>Because the two object sets look very similar, but are not totally
interchangable, when a browser finds a script that defines its content with
ECMAScript, it shall determine which set of objects to support based on the
declared protocol type if the script code is inlined. Scripts that require
backwards compatibility shall use the protocol type &quot;<B><code><span style="font-weight: 400">javascript:</span></code></b>&quot;.
The objects and semantics from ISO/IEC 14772-1 Annex C are to be used. In all
other cases, it is assumed to be the semantics and objects defined in this part
of ISO/IEC 19777.</p>
<p>External access to the browser shall be through the use of the objects and
semantics defined in this part of ISO/IEC 19777. A conformant browser shall only
support these objects and semantics when registering standard objects with the
containing application&#39;s ECMAScript engine. Although
<a href="references.html#[I14772_2]">part 2 of ISO/IEC14772</a> does not
define formal bindings to the browser for ECMAScript programming, it shall be an
error to support VRML objects and semantics if the browser claims
conformance to this specification.</p>

</a>4.2 Overview</h1>

<h2><a name="General"></a>4.2.1 General</h2>

<p>When a user wishes to interact with an X3D scene graph through 
use of custom code, either as a Script node as defined in <i>29 Scripting component</i> 
of part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[19775-1</a>])
or from external applications, they shall use the Scene Authoring
Interface (SAI) defined in this part of ISO/IEC 19775. This interface is a protocol
for manipulating the X3D scene graph while not directly part of the scene graph
itself.</p>

<p>This specification is aimed at providing a language neutral representation
of all actions that can be performed by an external application across
this interface. Bindings
to specific languages are defined in <a href="references.html#[I19777]">
2.[I19777]</a>. The SAI forms a
common interface that can be used either for manipulating the browser and the 
scene graph from either an external application or from inside the scene graph 
through the Script node. However, it is not possible for code written for an 
external application to be immediately usable as a script. The two environments 
have quite different requirements and abilities to access and interact with the 
scene graph. This specification provides a single, unified programmatic 
interface and  constraints that depend on the environment in which the code 
finds itself. </p>

<p>Conceptually, the SAI allows five types of
access into the X3D scene:</p>

<ul>
  <li> accessing the functionality of the Browser;</li><li>
  receive notifications of the actions of the Browser, such as bad URLs, startup 
  and shutdown;<br>
  </li>
<li>sending events to input-capable fields of nodes inside the scene;</li>
<li>reading the last value sent from output-capable fields of nodes inside the 
scene; and</li>
<li>getting notified when events change values of node fields inside the scene.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="VRMLScripting"></a>4.2.2&nbsp; Compatibility with ISO/IEC 14772</h2>

<p>If an X3D browser wishes to conform to ISO/IEC 14772 (VRML) (see
<a href="references.html#[I14772_1]">2.[I14772-1]</a>), the browser shall 
support the event model and semantics defined in <a href="vrml97.html">Annex A 
VRML scripting backwards compatibility</a> in addition to the functionality 
specified in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775. Such support shall only be used when 
processing files that conform to ISO/IEC 14772-1.</p>

<p>If an X3D browser wishes to conform to ISO/IEC 14772-2 (EAI) (see
<a href="references.html#[I14772_2]">2.[I14772-2]</a>), the browser shall use 
the following rules to determine content validity:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>If the user code accesses the browser through the EAI, only VRML <br>
  files as specified in ISO/IEC 14772-2 shall be loaded. It shall be an error to 
  process files that conform to this part of ISO/IEC 19775 if the user code is 
  accessing the browser through the EAI.</li>
  <li>If the user code accesses the browser through the capabilities provided
  <br>
  by the external interactions defined in this part of ISO/IEC 19775, only X3D 
  files as defined in Part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 shall be loaded. If shall be an 
  error to process files that conform to ISO/IEC 14772 if the user code is 
  accessing the browser through the SAI.</li>
</ol>

<h1><img class="cube" src="../Images/cube.gif" alt="cube" />
<a name="ImplementationDependencies"></a>4.3 Binding and protocol dependencies</h1>

<p>Implementation dependence is defined in terms of the language binding or
protocol encoding of the services defined in this specification. If a service
is defined to be implementation dependent, it is a requirement of each
binding and encoding to specify how that service is to be implemented,
if at all.</p>

<p>Bindings and encodings to these services may define their own implementation
dependent parts within that specification.</p>

<h1><img class="cube" src="../Images/cube.gif" alt="cube" />
<a name="InterfaceConstructs"></a>4.4 Interface constructs</h1>

<h2>
<a name="Concepts"></a>
4.4.1 Overview</h2>

<p>There are four main data collections in an X3D browser that can be accessed
using the services of the SAI: The browser, meta data about the currently
loaded scene, nodes within the scene graph, and fields within nodes. The
definition and specifications are framed in terms of services. An X3D browser
exposes a set of services that allow external applications to interact with
it. In order to describe these concepts, a number of terms are defined.</p>

<h2>
<a name="UserCode"></a>
4.4.2 User code</h2>

<p>Any code that makes use of the services defined in this part of ISO/IEC 19775 is considered
to be user code. User code may exist either within the scene graph or external
to the browser. It shall only use the services provided by this part and
no browser implementation specific services. In addition, these services
are not designed for, nor intended to be used for, writing native node extensions
to a specific browser. A browser may provide their own proprietary programmatic
interfaces to implement native extensions that are not part of this specification.
If code uses proprietary extensions, it shall not be considered user code
for the purposes of this Part.</p>

<h2><a name="ContainingNode"></a>4.4.3 Containing node</h2>

<p>A containing node is the node in the scene graph that is responsible for 
representing user code that wishes to take part in Internal Interactions (see <a href="#InternalInteractions">4.8.2 Internal Interactions</a>). The life
cycle of user code  shall be governed entirely by the containing
node. When the containing node becomes live, the user code becomes live.
When the containing node is removed and is no longer considered live
as defined in <i>4.4.2.5 Object life cycle</i> of part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>), the user code contained by that node shall be terminated.
User code cannot prolong the lifetime of the containing node by keeping a
reference to its containing node. The browser is the final arbiter of when the
containing node is no longer live.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for there to be a one-to-one mapping between a containing
node and its user code. Language bindings may permit one instance of user
code to be shared between multiple instances of a containing node.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Application"></a>
4.4.4 Application</h2>

<p>An application is the external process that is not implicitly part of the X3D
browser. This application makes some form of connection to the X3D browser along
which requests are made of the browser. The application does not exist as part
of the X3D browser as defined in <i>Figure 4.1</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 
(see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>) nor forms part of the 
execution model defined in <i>4.4.8.3 Execution model</i> of <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">
2.[I19775-1]</a>.
An application may reside on another  machine from the X3D browser. An application
may be responsible for creating a new browser instance that is embedded within
that application or attaching itself to an already running instance of a
browser (for example, an applet on a web page).</p>

<h2>
<a name="Session"></a>
4.4.5 Session</h2>

<p>A session defines the life of a single connection between the user code
and the X3D browser. It is possible for a single browser to be servicing
multiple sessions simultaneously (for example,
multiple script nodes in the one scene).</p>

<p>A single application
may contain a number of separate sessions to multiple browsers,
but a single script node shall not. Multiple
simultaneous sessions between external applications and multiple X3D browsers
is permissible. However, individual implementations may place some restrictions
on such multiple simultaneous sessions.</p>

<p>A session is not an implementable part of this specification. It is
purely a conceptual mechanism by which the user can make requests for
services. It may exist prior to any connection being established between
a browser and external application or is established simultaneously
with the request for a browser connection.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Browser"></a>
4.4.6 Browser</h2>

<p>The browser is the basic encapsulation mechanism for an active X3D scene
graph (that is one where time is progressing, not as a file stored on
disk). As it contains the entire scene graph,&nbsp;it also provides a
minimal core set of capabilities for dynamically manipulating that scene graph
at a coarse level.</p>

<p>A user may have many X3D browsers running simultaneously on their machine.
Therefore, each browser shall be represented by a unique identifier within
that session. This identifier is required to be identical for multiple
requests of a single browser instance. This is to enable two applications
that have access to the one browser instance to share information in an unambiguous
way.</p>

<p>Any action that requires use of the browser functionality shall identify
the service request with a browser identifier.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Scene"></a>
4.4.7 Scene</h2>

<p>A scene represents a single X3D scene graph and all information about
that scene graph. The scene is the programmatic equivalent of a X3D file.
It may contain nodes, routes, proto declarations, imports and
exports and all information
a valid X3D file may contain. A browser may contain one or more scenes at
any given time. For example one scene uses an Inline node to include another
scene.</p>

<p>A scene is not required to be live or running in the browser. A user may
construct a new scene that is not attached to a browser instance and then
programmatically fill in information such as nodes and routes. This scene
may then be passed directly to a utility program such as a pretty printer
for publishing a source file or used to replace the current scene in the
browser.</p>

<h2><a name="Node"></a>
4.4.8 Node</h2>

<p>The smallest unit of interaction with the elements in the scene graph is the 
node. A node is equivalent to the X3D nodes that are defined in part 1 of ISO/IEC 
19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>). A node can be removed as a unit from the scene graph, stored, and
then re-inserted at another position at some later time in the same session
without detrimental effect.</p>

<p>Each node is defined by a unique identifier. This identifier is unique
for that session. That is, it is possible that a single browser may be servicing
multiple applications simultaneously and therefore all node identifiers are
unique and invariant for the life of the session. This allows two external
applications to potentially share data between themselves unambiguously and
still have either make service requests of the browser with that shared data.</p>

<p>Most operations in the SAI begin by obtaining a reference to a node.
There are multiple ways to gain a reference to a node. It may be named using
the DEF construct and fetched using the appropriate service or it may be
obtained by walking the scene graph from some arbitrary parent node. Once a 
reference is obtained, all fields of that node may be accessed, but not 
necessarily read or written, including initializeOnly fields. Since an inputOutput field implicitly may be both read 
and written, these are
accessible using the field name or with the <i>set_</i> and <i>_changed</i>
modifiers.</p>

<p>A node reference undergoes a lifecycle during which different capabilities
are available. The lifecycle can be expressed as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creation: The node is first instantiated by the browser internals with all field values set to defaults</li>
  <li>Setup: Field values are changed from the default value where required</li>
  <li>Realized: The node is participating in the scene graph and/or scripting</li>
  <li>Disposed: The node is no longer part of a scene graph and no remaining references to it exist at the scripting level.</li>
</ol>

<p>Field access for reading and writing is dependent on the state of the
node. The states and capabilities are defined
in <a href="#t-Fieldaccess">Table 4.2</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The transition from setup to realized states may be either implicit or explicit.
A service request exists so that the user may make a formal notification
that setup is now finished and the node can complete whatever internal construction
is required. The transition may be implicit due to the user's actions. At
the point the user does anything with the node reference other than set the
field values, the node shall transition to the realized state. For example,
the user creates a Box node, sets the size field, creates a Shape node then
immediately adds the Box to a Shape node, shall result in the state of the
Box node changing to Realized, while leaving the Shape node in the setup state.</p>

<p>Node identifiers may also be used to represent an empty node. An
empty SFNode or MFNode field value is represented by a <code>NULL</code> value.
For empty MFNode fields, the count of available nodes shall be zero
when the field value is <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Field"></a>
4.4.9 Field</h2>

<p>Individual fields are within nodes. While it is not possible to directly
manipulate a node, a field is the method of direct manipulation of individual
properties.</p>

<p>It is not possible to directly manipulate a node's properties as  entities 
separate from the node itself (i.e., fields do not exist outside their 
containing nodes).</p>

<p>The access granted to individual fields is defined by Part 1 of this 
standard. A field is assigned a field identifier. This is non-unique and 
requires a node identifier plus the field identifier to specify a particular 
field with which to interact. When accessing a field, the user shall be given 
the identifier to the whole field. All fields are implicitly treated as being 
both readable and writable by the service definition. Flags are used to indicate 
whether that field can be read or written at that point in time (and dependent 
on the node&#39;s state in the lifecycle as described in <a href="#t-Fieldaccess">Table 4.2</a>). This state
may change over time as the node progresses through its lifecycle. For example,
an initializeOnly field of a non-live node may be  writable, but once that node
is inserted into the scene graph, it shall no longer be writable. This
is to aid authoring tools and users that wish to programmatically construct
a scene around a third party browser.</p>

<p>Fields may be read or written at any time during the course of the session.
User code may register and unregister to receive notification of when values
of the field changes. During the registration process the user code can supply
a token that will be returned along with the data value of the event. This
token can be used by the user code to uniquely identify this event in cases
where events are not implicitly unique. The token is not required to be passed
along with the service request and may be kept as part of the internals of
the implementation on the application interface.</p>

<p>Any output-capable field of a node to which the application
has a reference can be read.
The value read is the last value sent by that field or the default value
for that field type if no event has ever been sent. The data read is specific
to the field type of that field and is formatted appropriate to the language
or protocol used.</p>

<h2>
<a name="ExecutionContext"></a>
4.4.10 Execution context</h2>

An execution context is the run-time semantic equivalent to a name scope described in 
<i>4.4.7 Run-time name scope</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>). It provides a way of containing and firewalling internal
interaction code in such a manner as to represent the same restrictions that a
name space provides in the file format. For example, when a script inside a
Proto instance adds a ROUTE, the route is added to the internals of the proto
and not to the general scene.</p>

<p>A scene is a derived type of execution context. When the internal interaction 
requests the current execution context, a scene object is returned. The user code may then check to see if the execution context is an
instance of a full scene and  behave appropriately by casting up to the
derived type, if available.</p>

<a name="Events"></a>
4.5 Events</h2>

<h2>
<a name="EventsConcepts"></a>
4.5.1 Concepts</h2>

<p>Any transient  data is carried around the X3D scene graph through
the use of events. The application may register to receive events from
the X3D scene graph, and may initiate new events. Events are considered
transient and generated only at the time when the specific action occurs.
Events shall not be stored and have the delivery deferred to parties who
have not expressed interest in the event at the time it occurred. For example
an application that connects to a browser after the world has loaded shall
not be delivered an Initialize event.</p>

<h2>
<a name="InternalToBrowser"></a>
4.5.2 Internal to browser</h2>

<p>An application may write a value to a field or read a value from a field.
This value does not become an event until that value is internally represented
within the X3D browser. The border of the browser to the application is
where an event stops. Events cannot exist externally from the X3D browser;
that is, the application cannot be inserted in the middle of an event cascade.
The application may be notified of events, initiate new events, but cannot
process and pass on events while holding up processing of the current timestamp
event cascades within the browser when it is notified of an event.</p>

<p>An event is not generated until a cascade is created. If an internal interaction
directly writes to an output-capable field of another node, no event is generated
and therefore does not form part of the event cascade. If the internal interaction
writes to a input-capable field of the containing node, an event is formed with the 
written value, if the field is the subject of a ROUTE from somewhere else.</p>

<h2>
<a name="BrowserToExternalApp"></a>
4.5.3 Browser to external application</h2>

<h3>
<a name="BrowserToExternalAppOver"></a>
4.5.3.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The browser may directly communicate to external applications with its
own set of events. These events are used to indicate the status of the
browser or of some asynchronous problem. The number and type of events
available shall be implementation dependent. At a minimum, the following
events shall be provided in all implementations of this specification.</p>

<p>Event delivery from the browser to the external application shall be
guaranteed.</p>

<h3>
<a name="Initialize"></a>
4.5.3.2 Initialize</h3>

<p>The initialize event is used to indicate that the browser has had a scene
loaded where it has run through the initialization process (where the browser
has loaded the world and just before it is about to issue its first time-related
event). At this point in time, node identifiers shall be available from
the getNode service of the scene (see <a href="servRef.html#getNode">6.4.8 getNode</a>).</p>

<p>The initialize event shall be generated immediately at the browser and
delivered to the application. The event is considered to be asynchronous.
That is, the delivery of the event (and any implementation dependent acknowledgement
scheme) shall not delay the browser in starting the execution model evaluation.</p>

<h3>
<a name="Shutdown"></a>
4.5.3.3 Shutdown</h3>

<p>The shutdown event is used to indicate that the browser is about to stop
running the current scene. This may occur under a number of different conditions:</p>

<p>The shutdown event shall be generated immediately at the browser and

the delivery of the event to the application.</p>

<a name="NoURLsAvailable"></a>4.5.3.4 No URLs available</h3>

<p>The no URL event is used to notify the application that the browser was
not able to load any of the URL/URNs in one of the asynchronous invocations
of the <span class="code"> <b>loadURL</b></span> service
(See <a href="servRef.html#loadURL">6.3.12 loadURL</a>).
This indicates that no valid content was able to be
loaded from any of the URLs specified in this call. Other calls that
may involve other asynchronous loads such as <span class="code"> <b>replaceWorld</b></span>
(see <a href="servRef.html#replaceWorld">6.3.10 replaceWorld</a>)
and <span class="code"> <b>createX3DFromString</b></span> and <span class="code"> <b>createX3DFromStream</b></span>

<a href="servRef.html#createX3DFromStream">6.3.15 createX3DFromStream</a>)
may also use this event to indicate loading problems
for any X3DUrlNode
as specified in <i>9.3.2 X3DUrlObject</i> of part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>)

<h3>
<a name="ConnectionLost"></a>
4.5.3.5 Connection lost</h3>

<p>The connection lost error is used to notify the application that the underlying
implementation has lost the connection between the browser and the application
that would result in service requests not being able to be honoured. An
example would be a TCP network connection timing out or other similar problem.</p>

<p>An implementation may delay sending an event that the connection has
been lost if it implements some automatic reconnection attempt. It shall
only be sent at the point where it is deemed no longer possible to connect
to the browser. There shall be no requirement for the implementation to
attempt to re-establish the connection after this event has been generated
or to attempt any form of automatic reconnection capability.</p>

<a name="Identifiers"></a>4.6 Identifiers</h1>

<p>What constitutes an identifier is implementation dependent. In some cases
it may be more efficient to represent a node identifier as the entire node
which includes all field information. Requests for field information are
then made on the local node. In other implementations an identifier may
be only a simple integer. The job of ensuring unique identifiers is the
sole responsibility of the browser such that applications may share data
within reasonable constraints of the environment. The constraints on that
environment may be specified as part of the individual implementation as
defined in the attached appendices.</p>

<p>It is not considered reasonable that two applications using different
service implementations be able to exchange data outside of the browser
environment.</p>

<p><i>9.2.2 Relative URLs</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>) 
specifies the rules for dealing with relative URLs within a browser
environment. The declaring file shall be defined as the base URL of the currently
loaded world in the browser. The currently loaded world can be obtained by a request
of the <span class="code">getWorldURL</span> service (see <a href="servRef.html#getWorldURL">6.4.5 getWorldURL</a>).
In the case where a browser does not yet have an X3D file loaded, the base document
directory shall be taken to be the current working directory of the browser. Where
the browser is part of a web page, the current working directory shall be treated
as the base URL of the page in which the web browser is embedded.
<p>When nested relative URLs are generated (such as an EXTERNPROTO containing
a reference to a script file) the top level RURL base is then resolved in

<a name="ExecutionModel"></a>4.8 Execution model</h2>

<h2>
<a name="InteractionTypes"></a>
4.8.1 Overview of the interaction types</h2>

<p>Because the SAI fulfills the role of the programmatic interface for both 
external applications and scripts, the execution model is capable of working in 
both situations. Although the API calls are identical for both situations, the 
run-time evaluation of each service request may be different. For example, 
servicing a field changed notification in a script shall stop the current event 
cascade, but for an external application it shall not. This specification 
defines two types of interactions that services may participate in: internal 
(i.e., a script) and external (i.e., an application).</p>

<h2><a name="EventModelEvaluation"></a>
4.8.2 Event model evaluation order</h2>

Scripting code allows the user to modify the scene graph with custom behaviours.
For consistent effects, the evaluation order defined in 
<i>4.4.8.3 Execution model</a></i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>) is
expanded to include the service interactions allowed by a script. When
internal interaction code is provided, the following order shall be used to
evaluate all aspects of the event model.<ol>
<li>Update camera based on currently bound Viewpoint's position and
orientation.</li>
<li>Evaluate sensor input.</li>
<li>Gather external input from buffer and pass to nodes.</li>
<li>Call the prepareEvents script service for all live script nodes in
    the scene</i>.<li>Evaluate routes.</li>
<li>Call the shutdown service on scripts that have received set_url
    events or are being removed from the scene</li>
<li>Generate final events for any sensors removed from the scene.</li>
<li>Add/remove any routes required by an invocation of the dynamicRouteHandling
    service request as defined in <a href="servRef.html#DynamicRouteHandling">
6.4.16 dynamicRouteHandling</a> from any script execution in step 6.</li>
<li>Call the eventsProcessed script service for scripts that have sent
    events generated in step 6.</li>
<li> Call the initialize service for newly loaded internal interaction code.</li>
<li>If any events were generated from steps 5 through 10, go to step 5 and
    continue.</li>
</ol>

<p>If an internal interaction registers any form of callback or listener
functionality with objects defined by this specification, those callbacks
are made at the time the change occurs. For example, a user code in Script A
issues an event on an outputOnly field during the initialize service handling,
and another piece of user code in Script B has a listener service on that
eventOut. The listener would be fired immediately after the user code in Script
A exits and returns control to the browser core.</p>

<h2><a name="InternalInteractions"></a>
4.8.3 Internal interactions</h2>

<h3><a name="IntPermittedInteractions"></a>
4.8.3.1 Permitted interactions</h3>

<p>An internal interaction is when the user code and containing node forms part 
of the X3D scene graph. These nodes are subject to and participate in the event 
cascade evaluation. Internal interactions may occur in the middle of the event 
cascade as a direct result of receiving an event, and may generate one or more 
output events in response. These events shall continue in the current cascade. 
When the output events are generated from asynchronous script evaluation or from 
some other process not directly related to processing of the current event 
cascade as defined in <i>29.2.4 EventsProcessed()</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>), 
a completely new
event cascade is started.</p>

<p>An X3DScriptNode type as specified in <i>29.3.1 X3DScriptNode</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 
19775 
(see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>)
specifies a containing node although other node types may also be defined in the future.
A browser shall only permit internal interactions by user code that is referenced from a
X3DScriptNode type or other future defined containing node type. If the user
code is referenced from any other node type, it shall consider the code as an
external interaction and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Internal interactions also permit direct interaction with fields of
other nodes, or some browser operations without participating in the event
cascade. This action shall only be allowed dependent on the value of the
<i>directOutput</i> field setting of the containing
<i>X3DScriptNode</i> node. The definitions of when this behaviour is permitted
is defined in <i>29 Scripting component</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).</p>

<p>Because the user code is considered to be held inside of the containing node,
the view of the node's fields are reversed to the normal situation. An inputOnly field
is a readable field, not writable; an outputOnly field is a writable field,
not readable; and an initializeOnly as well as an inputOutput field are both readable and writable. Contrast
this with an external node that is not the containing node in
<a href="#t-InteractionsLiveNode">Table 4.3</a>. This resembles the type of 
access that any other built-in or native extension node may have.</p>

<h3><a name="IntBrowserInteractions"></a>
4.8.3.2 Browser interactions</h3>

<p>Internal interactions are permitted with the browser. Because the code lies inside the current
scene, they are only permitted a limited set of the full browser services.
The services clause outlines which services will be available to internal
actions and which are off limits.</p>

<p>During the initialization phase of the internal action, a script shall be
given a reference to the browser that is appropriate for its interactions.
This shall remain constant throughout the lifetime of the script while it
its containing node is considered live.</p>

<h3><a name="RespondingToEvents"></a>
4.8.3.3 Responding to events</h3>

<p>The purpose of an internal interaction is to respond to events, provide some 
processing and, optionally, also generate new output for the containing node. It 
may, also, provide asynchronous output that does not correspond to any input 
through the use of one or more threads. Generating output is considered in&nbsp; <a href="#ExtUpdatingSceneGraph">4.8.3.4 Updating the scene graph</a>. 
4.8.3.4 describes the issues of responding to input resulting from an
event cascade that sends an event to one or more output-capable fields of the containing
node.</p>

<p>In order to respond to events, user code registers interest in the appropriate
field(s) of the containing node. Interest may be registered with all field
access types except outputOnly fields of the containing node. Once the containing
node has completed its initialization phase any time that one of the fields
of the containing node receives an event the user code shall be notified
of this through the notification mechanism provided by the language-specific
bindings. The browser may choose to either immediately notify the user code
or to batch a number of events together and provide a deferred notification.
In either case, the browser shall ensure that all events for that timestamp
are delivered during that timestamp and not at some later time.
The browser shall also obey the containing node's
<i>mustEvaluate </i>field directive as specified in <i>29.4.1 Script</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 
19775 
(see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>)
when deciding whether to defer or immediately notify.</p>

<p>Upon notification, the browser shall not process any more events in the
containing node's event cascade until processing has returned from the user
code (although this does permit other event cascades to continue simultaneous
processing). Values written to fields of other nodes and the input-capable fields
of the containing node shall not be passed on to the destination node before
the user code has relinquished control. Note that this does not exclude a
browser implementation from delivering multiple events simultaneously to
the user code if there are parallel event cascades being evaluated (for example
a browser running on a multi-CPU machine where parallel event cascades can
be evaluated and result in two cascades delivering events to the containing
node simultaneously). The writer of the user code should be aware of and
take appropriate precautions for this situation.</p>

<p>When the browser has determined that the cascade or cascades are completed,
the browser may then call the containing node's <span class="code">eventProcessed()</span> method 
as defined in <i>29.2.4 EventsProcessed()</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).
The user code is also notified of this situation and the user code may then
choose to perform extra evaluation and generate more output. User code for
internal notifications has no way of determining when the current rendered
frame has finished and the next frame begins.</p>

<h3><a name="UpdatingTheSceneGraph"></a>4.8.3.4 Updating the scene graph</h3>

<p>User code may choose to generate output in addition to receive inputs. For
internal interactions, user code is not required to generate output in response
to inputs. User code may asynchronously generate output or write directly
to other nodes at any time that the containing node is considered
live, within certain restrictions that are outlined in
<a href="#RespondingToEvents">4.8.3.3 Responding to events</a> and <a href="#AsynchronousActions">4.8.2.5 Asynchronous Actions</a>.</p>

<p>User code has two options for influencing the scene graph; it may write
to the output-capable fields of the containing node and have the values be subject to
the usual event cascade, or it may directly write to the input-capable fields of another
node to which the containing node and user code already has a reference. User
code may write to the containing node's fields at any time and in accordance
with the access rules defined
in <a href="#t-Fieldaccess">Table 4.2</a>. Internal interactions with other nodes shall be
subject to the rules defined by the containing node's <i>directOutput</i> field 
as specified in <i>29.2.6 Scripts with direct outputs</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).</a>

<p>There are two special cases of user code not being permitted to make changes
to fields of the containing node. The two fields of the X3DScriptNode abstract
type <i>mustEvaluate</i> and <i>directOutput</i> are considered special and
the user code shall not be permitted to modify these values at runtime. User
code may read the values. If the containing node is also derived from the
X3DUrlNode abstract type, it may choose to change its own URL fields,
thereby replacing the current user code with new user code.</p>

<h3><a name="AsynchronousActions"></a>
4.8.3.5 Asynchronous actions</h3>

<p>User code in some languages are allowed to operate using asynchronous threads
of execution. These allow user code to run without the need for direct stimulus
from the browser. A typical use of this situation is to monitor a network
connection for changes to be made to the scene graph. This requires the use
of internal interactions that are not created as a direct result of field
changes being received by the user code.</p>

<p>Internal interactions are only permitted at the times
specified by <a href="#InternalUserCodeLifeCycle">4.8.3.7 User code lifecycle</a>.
The browser shall generate an error if user code attempts to make internal
interactions at any other time. The <span class="code">prepareEvents</span> service (see
<a href="servRef.html#prepareEvents">6.10.3.1 prepareEvents</a>), if defined
by the user code, allows user code to perform completely
asynchronous changes to the scene graph, at known points in time, without
the need to clock the script using a TimeSensor or other node.
This is in contrast to the <span class="code"> <b>eventsProcessed</b></span>
service (see <a href="servRef.html#6.9.4.1">6.10.3.2 eventsProcessed</a>),
which is only called after the containing node has had to process field changes.</p>

<p>In addition, when user code registers for one of the listener services,
the callbacks associated with this are considered asynchronous actions. User
code operating during this period, shall not be permitted to make modifications
to the scene graph.</p>


<h3>
<a name="IntMonitoringChanges"></a>
4.8.3.6 Monitoring changes in the scene graph</h3>

<p>The services definition for fields allows user code to register interest
in the output of fields of other nodes. Internal interaction code shall not
be permitted to register interest in field change information. If the user
code wishes to be informed of field change information, it shall use the
existing route mechanism and the appropriate scene services to add a route
between the field of interest and an input-capable field of the containing
node.</p>

<p>Internal user code may add register interest in the output-capable fields of other
nodes. This shall only be permitted when the containing
node's <i>directOutput</i> field is set to <span class="code">TRUE</span>. It shall be an
error to allow user code to register interest in outputs if this
value set to <span class="code">FALSE</span>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="InternalUserCodeLifeCycle"></a>
4.8.3.7 User code lifecycle</h3>

<h4>
<a name="UserCodeLifeCycleOverview"></a>4.8.3.7.1 Overview</h4>

<p>The lifecycle of user code is important to know in order to maintain and
effectively utilize resources from the underlying operating system. For user
code involved in internal interactions, the lifecycle of the code is dependent
on the lifecycle of the containing node. The user code shall have no greater
life time than the containing node, although it may be shorter. The lifetime
of user code may be shorter for many reasons, but principle reasons may include
the download time needed to fetch the code from a remote site, other user
code changing the URL of the containing node to replace the current user
code with other user code. However, the lifecycle of user code follows the
same basic principles of the containing node. It has the same phases and
undergoes similar transitions.</p>

<p>The lifecycle of the containing node is defined in <i>4.4.2.5 Object
life cycle</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">
2.[I19775-1]</a>).</p>

<h4>
<a name="Setup"></a>4.8.3.7.2 Setup </h4>

<p>It is assumed that there will be some delay, however small, between when
the containing node is initialized and when the user code will go through
its initialization phase. While the containing node may already have finished
the initialization phase and be in the running phase, the user code may not
have started or may be processing its initialization.</p>

<p>During the initialization phase, internal interaction code is given all the
information it needs for the rest of its lifecycle. The first step of the
initialization phase is the instantiation of the user code. At instantiation,
user code has no information about its containing environment or the containing
node. During this time the user code may elect set up any resources it requires,
such as threads, network connections or any other permitted actions of the
containing environment
(see <a href="#ExecutionEnvironmentAndSecurity">4.8.3.9 Execution environment and security</a>).</p>

<p>After instantiation, the user code receives notification of resources needed
to function within the internal interaction environment. It is given the
identifier of the containing browser, the list of fields of a node (excluding
any special fields) and the identifier of the containing node (needed so
that user code may add and remove routes to it's containing node). User code
shall not make any service requests with the one exception of printing
messages during this period and if it does, the
browser shall generate an error.</p>

<p>As the last step of the initialization phase, the user code shall have its
<span class="code">
<b>initialize</b></span>
service called (see <a href="servRef.html#Topics">6.10.2.3 initialize</a>). At this point user code is free to make use of
all the services available to internal interactions. For example, this would
be a good time for the user code to register for change notifications of
the containing node fields, or to perform external tasks like bind a particular
viewpoint.</p>

<h4>
<a name="Realization"></a>4.8.3.7.3 Realization</h4>

<p>During the runtime phase, user code is subject to the requirements of this
clause for receiving, sending and monitoring events as well as the X3D execution
model.</p>

<p>User code is restricted about when it may make modifications to the scene
graph. It shall only be permissible to make modification in response to prompts
from the browser. The permitted times shall be defined as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>During the pre-event cascade processing service request <span class="code"> <b>prepareEvents</b></span>
      (see <a href="servRef.html#prepareEvents">6.10.3.1 prepareEvents</a>);<li>In response to a change notification for an 
  input-capable field of the containing node; and</li>
  <li>During the post-event processing service request through the
  <span class="code">
      <b>eventsProcessed</b></span> service request (see
      <a href="servRef.html#eventsProcessed">6.10.3.2 eventsProcessed</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>It shall be an error for user to make a service request at any time other
than these where asynchronous interactions are not permitted. Each service request
in <a href="servRef.html">6 Service Requests</a> defines whether user code is 
permitted to make asynchronous requests.

<h5>
<a name="Disposal"></a>4.8.3.7.4 Disposal</h5>

<p>User code will enter the shutdown phase when either the node is no longer
live or the actions of other user code has resulted in the user code being
removed from the containing node (eg changing the URL of a script node to
point at new executable content).</p>

<p>Notification of the change to the shutdown phase shall be through the calling
of the <span class="code"> <b>shutdown</b></span> service request in the user code
(see <a href="servRef.html#ScriptShutdown">6.10.4.1 shutdown</a>).
During this phase user code may set values to an output-capable field of the containing nodes or write final values directly to 
the input-capable fields of other nodes. At the end
of the phase, the identifiers to the browser and containing fields shall be
considered as invalid. For example, if the user code contains a thread that
continues to operate after the shutdown phase, it shall not be permitted to
make modifications to the scene graph. To do so shall generate an error.</p>

<h3><a name="inputOutputFieldsContainingNode"></a>4.8.3.8 inputOutput fields and the containing node</h3>

<p>The containing node is permitted to have fields with the inputOutput access
type. Because an inputOutput field represents both an inputOnly and outputOnly field
the user code may wish to write to the values, user code is subject to some
special conditions in order to remain consistent with the core specification.</p>

<p>For the purposes of  defining the allowable behaviour, the containing
node and the user code are considered as decoupled, non-related entities.
Notification of changes in field values are a notification, and no more.
Setting the value of a field that is defined as inputOutput is considered to be
an instantaneous, atomic action. When the field is set, the value
for both the input and output are set immediately. Then the notification
to the user code is performed. Since the output of the inputOutput field has been
set, any further attempt to change the value of the inputOutput field during the
current timestamp is considered to be subject to <i>4.4.6.1 Loops</i> in of part 1 of ISO/IEC 
19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).
That is, if the user code receives an event notification for its containing
node's inputOutput field, it cannot write another value to that same inputOutput 
field during the same timestamp because&nbsp; an output event has already been issued and
the containing node is not permitted to issue another output event for the same 
field in the same
timestamp. </p>

<p>In receiving events, the script shall only pass through the first event received
by the containing node of the inputOutput field.</p>

<p>If the containing node has not yet received a change on the field
during the current timestamp,  the user code is permitted to write a
value to the field. If a change is received to the field after
the user code has modified it,  only the inputOnly portion of the node
is processed. A notification is sent to the user code, but the value of the
field shall not be changed in accordance with the loop breaking rule in <i>4.4.6.1 
Loops</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).</p>

<p>A containing node may have a number of pre-defined fields. These fields shall
be accessible and readable by the user code, but shall not be writable.</p>

<h3><a name="ExecutionEnvironmentAndSecurity"></a>4.8.3.9 Execution environment and security</h3>

<p>All user code participating within a particular internal interaction environment
is considered to operate within a single execution space. Code in this context
is subject to the security settings of the containing browser's environment
and also the language's operating environment. This permits user code in
internal interactions to communicate through asynchronous mechanisms that
are external to the X3D execution environment (i.e., route and event evaluation).
Some language bindings may be subject to more restrictions than others. This
is implementation independent. For example, user code using the Java language
bindings may operate in a web-browser sand box that does not allow network
connections to any external server, while user code using the COM bindings
may be given full access to the entire underlying operating system.</p>

<p>For security purposes, a browser may implement whatever schemes it feels
necessary to ensure good security and to prevent content from undertaking
nefarious activities. Such activities may include virus-like modification
of the user's computer or denial of service activities or any other activity
deemed a security risk on the day.</p>

<p>User code that is interacting with a browser from an external perspective
is considered to have complete control over the entire lifecycle of not only
the scene graph but also the browser. External interactions therefore have
the full range of control over the browser.</p>

<p>Because an application is consider to be external to the browser, it does
not have intimate knowledge of the internal state and therefore when actions
may or may not be safe to make. Therefore, the external interactions are
defined to be in an advisory capacity. An external interaction requests the
browser make changes and then the browser shall decide exactly when it it
safe to act on those requests. A browser shall honour all requests made,
within the bounds of the individual services guideline outlined below.</p>

<p>An external application may also wish to monitor changes in nodes, fields
and even the browser itself. The browser shall inform the external application
of the changes, but shall do so in an asynchronous way. That is, any updates
are considered to be notifications only, and shall not hold up the browser's
internal evaluations. The result is that notifications may make it to the
external application with some delay from when they happened within the browser.
(For example an external application sitting on a remote computer to the
browser and the associated networking delays that the browser has no control
over.)</p>

<h3><a name="ExtBrowserInteractions"></a>4.8.4.2 Browser interactions</h3>

<p>Browser interactions for external interactions include all the basic services
provided to internal interactions. In addition to this a number of additional
interactions are allowed. A single external application is permitted to interact
with more than one browser at a time. It may also instruct multiple browsers
to act together as a single entity or to work individually. The lifetime
of the external application is independent of the browser.</p>

<h3><a name="ExtUpdatingSceneGraph"></a>
4.8.4.3 Updating the scene graph</h3>

<p>A characteristic of external applications is that they will make a lot
of changes in bursts to the X3D browser. It is also possible that a single
browser may have a number of applications connected to it, all making requests
of the browser.</p>

<p>Events can be batched to aid in performance of the application. The
mechanism provided by this is a simple gate mechanism to hold all requests
(<code>beginUpdate</code>) to update the currently loaded world until the gate
is released (<code>endUpdate</code>).</p>

<p>When <code>beginUpdate</code> is invoked, all requests to modify the contents
of the current world are buffered and not passed to the browser. This buffering
effects all requests to modify the current world including calls to <code>loadURL</code>
and <code>replaceWorld</code>. Once a call to <code>beginUpdate</code> has been made,
any further <code>beginUpdate</code> requests are ignored until the next call
to <code>endUpdate</code>
at which time <code>endUpdate</code> releases all of the currently buffered updates
to the browser for processing.</p>

<p>If a modification service request is made on the scene after an
<span class="code"> <b>endUpdate</b></span>
and before a <code>beginUpdate</code>, it shall be passed to the scene immediately
with the timestamp at the discretion of the browser.</p>

<p><code>beginUpdate</code>/<code>endUpdate</code> requests shall be limited to the
individual session. A request by one application to <code>beginUpdate</code>
shall only buffer the requests made by that application and not any others
that may be connected to that same browser instance.</p>

<p>When <code>endUpdate</code> is invoked, the following order of execution of
requests shall be applied:</p>

<ol>
  <li> node setValues;</li>
  <li> event cascade evaluation as defined in <i>4.4.8.3 Execution model</i> of ISO/IEC 19775-1 (see
  <a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>loadURL</code>/<code>replaceWorld</code> service requests
are not affected by the update control process.
As soon as the browser receives these requests their execution is begun.
The service definitions define the complete behaviour of these requests.
<p>Buffered requests from the application shall be processed before processing
any more requests either through another buffered queue or individual requests.</p>

<h3><a name="ExtMonitoringChangesInTheSceneGraph"></a>4.8.4.4 Monitoring changes in the scene graph</h3>

<p>External interactions allow monitoring of any changes in the scene graph.
Notifications of these changes shall be delivered in a timely manner and
shall remain in the same sequence in which they are generated by the browser
internals.</p>

<h3>
<a name="SynchronizingMultipleApplications"></a>4.8.4.5 Synchronizing multiple applications</h3>

<p>When multiple applications make requests of the browser, the requests shall
be serviced in order of arrival time at the browser. The browser shall
determine the arrival time. Buffered updates to the scene graph shall have
their arrival time determined to be at the time that <code>endUpdate</code> is
requested. The arrival time is not necessarily the same as the timestamp
at which the browser chooses to send events into the scene graph. The timestamp
that the events are sent to the scene graph shall be determined by the
browser but shall be no earlier than the time that <code>endUpdate</code> is
requested. The arrival time is used to sort out conflicting requests from
multiple applications to ensure consistent results in the application of
events in the correct order.</p>

<p>Should the browser determine that two requests arrive simultaneously the result
is implementation dependent. Note that it is permissible for the external applications
to send new values to a given inputOnly field simultaneously. For such situations the
browser shall obey <i>4.4.8.5 Fan-in and fan-out</i> in part 1 of ISO/IEC 19775 (see
<a href="references.html#[I19775_1]">2.[I19775-1]</a>).</p>


<p>Should the browser receive a request to <span class="code"> <b>loadURL</b></span> or
<span class="code"> <b>replaceWorld</b></span>
while currently processing a similar request, the old request is immediately
terminated and the new one begun. See
<a href="servRef.html#replaceWorld">6.3.12 replaceWorld</a> and
<a href="servRef.html#loadURL">6.3.14 loadURL</a> for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="ServiceGuarantees"></a>4.8.5 Service guarantees</h3>

<p>All requests for services shall be guaranteed to be honoured where the underlying
implementation supports that service. Once the application has made a service
request, that request shall be transmitted to the browser assuming that a connection
is still available. That is, all communications are assumed to be reliable. Delivery
is not guaranteed if the connection between the browser and application has been
broken (for example, a TCP connection fails). Implementations shall define an
error condition that notifies the user that the connection has failed for each
service request. Also, the browser interface may include an event that provides
asynchronous notification to the user of the failure.</p>

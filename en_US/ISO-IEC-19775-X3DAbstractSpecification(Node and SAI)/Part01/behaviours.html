<p>This annex describes basic X3D scene navigation recommended 
practice. This recommended practice describes a browser-independent 
standardized keyboard interface which implements 
X3D frequently used scene interactivity.
Features that imply interactivity are fundamental in X3D. 
The author expects to be able to specify multiple viewpoints in a 
predicable sequence, the ability to point and select, 
and to enable continuous navigation within the scene. 
Likewise the interactor expects to 
be able to exercise scene functionality using predictable 
methods.</p>

<p>This recommended practice is intended to allow use of 
a core subset of the functionality of an X3D browser, 
not unnecessarily limit interactive functionality 
which may be provided by a browser.</p>

<a NAME="SelectFromMulitpleViewpoints"></a>G.2 Select from multiple viewpoints</H1> 

<p>User navigation in X3D environments includes definition of 
multiple viewpoints. Where the user is allowed to freely 
select between viewpoints, typical controls allow 
simple selection of: </p>
 
   <ul>
<li>Home (Initial) ViewPoint,</li> 
<li>Last (Final) Viewpoint,</li>
<li>Next Viewpoint in Sequence, and</li>
<li>Previous Viewpoint in Sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>This annex recommends using the following 
keys: </p>

<pre class="listing">HOME    Initial Viewpoint 
PGDN    Next Viewpoint 
PGUP    Previous Viewpoint 
END     Final Viewpoint 
</pre>

<h1><img class="cube" src="../Images/cube.gif" alt="cube" width="20" height="19">
<a NAME="EmulatePointDevice"></a>G.3 Emulate pointing device</H1>

<p>The pointing device is used to control navigation through the scene. Where 
the user is allowed to interact using the pointing device, typical controls 
allow up/down/right/left pointing device movement
to control movement of the viewpoint.</p>

   The objective is not to actually move the screen tracking cursor, but to allow 
navigation control as if the tracking cursor or pointer is moved under control 
of the pointing device.

<p>This annex recommends using the following 
(arrow) keys to emulate relative tracking pointer 
movement as follows:</p> 

<pre class="listing">UP        Up  
DOWN      Down 
LEFT      Left
RIGHT     Right
</pre>

<p>Activation of these keys causes movement of the viewpoint 
according to currently selected navigation type:</p>

<pre class="listing">WALK:      forward/backward/left/right
FLY:       forward/backward/left/right
EXAMINE:   orbit up/down/left/right around center of rotation
           with camera pointed at center of rotation
</pre>

<h1><img class="cube" src="../Images/cube.gif" alt="cube" width="20" height="19">
<a NAME="SelectOrActivatePointingDevice"></a>G.4 Select or activate pointing device</H1>
 
<p>The pointing device is used to provide 
a means of selecting of a scene 
element. Where the user is allowed to 
use this, the following action is recommended: activate pointing device (left mouse click).<p>This annex recommends using the following key:</p>

<pre class="listing">ENTER  Left Mouse Click
</pre>

<h1><img class="cube" src="../Images/cube.gif" alt="cube" width="20" height="19">
<a NAME="DisableEnableKeyboard"></a>G.5 Disable/enable keyboard</h1>

<p>It is recommended that the browser provide a 
means for the author to enable and  disable 
the keyboard.</p>

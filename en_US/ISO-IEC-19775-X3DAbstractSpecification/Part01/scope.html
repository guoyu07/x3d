<p>ISO/IEC 19775, X3D, defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 
  3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based 
  space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified 
  through a variety of mechanisms. This part of ISO/IEC 19775 defines the architecture 
  and base components of X3D.</p>

<p>The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional behaviour of time-based,
interactive 3D, multimedia information. This part of ISO/IEC 19775 does not define physical
devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts (e.g., screen resolution
and input devices). THis part of ISO/IEC 19775 is intended for a wide variety of devices
and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation
of the functionality. For example, this part of ISO/IEC 19775 does not assume the existence
of a mouse or 2D display device.</p>

<p>Each X3D application:</p>

<ol START="1" TYPE="a">
  <li>implicitly establishes a world coordinate space for all objects defined, 
    as well as all objects included by the application;</li> 
  <li>explicitly defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects;</li> 
  <li>can specify hyperlinks to other files and applications;</li> 
  <li>can define programmatic or data-driven object behaviours;</li>
  <li>can connect to external modules or applications via programming and scripting 
    languages;</li>
  <li>explicitly declares its functional requirements by specifying a profile;</li>
  <li>can declare additional functional requirements by specifying components.</li>
</ol>

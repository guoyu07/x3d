	requirements.</li>

	relationships specified in this part of ISO/IEC 19775 for the version 
	specified in the header statement producing the structure specified in the

	specified in this part of ISO/IEC 19775 for the version specified in the 
	header statement producing the structure specified in this part of ISO/IEC 
	19775 for the version specified in the header statement.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.iso.org/">ISO</a> (the International Organization for 
Standardization) and <a href="http://www.iec.ch/">IEC</a> (the International 
Electrotechnical Commission) form a specialized system for worldwide 
standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in 
the development of International Standards through technical committees 
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of 
technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of 
mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and 
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In 
the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint 
technical committee, <a href="http://www.jtc1.org/">ISO/IEC JTC 1</a>.</p>
<p>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the 
ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.</p>
<p>The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International 
Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical 
committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an 
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies 
casting a vote.</p>
<p>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this 
document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.</p>
<p>International Standard ISO/IEC 18024 was prepared by Joint Technical 
Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, <i>Information technology</i>, Subcommittee 24, <i>
Computer graphics and image processing</i>, in collaboration with
<a href="http://www.web3d.org/">Web3D Consortium, Inc.</a></p>
